#SP500 Market Helper
Uses wiki and yfinance to scrape the sp500 as a list and gives historical data up to the beginning of the company going public

main.py utilizes the wiki info of the SP500 
chart.py would run on barchart's market data instead of the wiki, but is locked behind barchart's paywall.

* To run, write in terminal: streamlit run main.py

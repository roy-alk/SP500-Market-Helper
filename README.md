# SP500 Market Helper
### Uses the SP500 wiki and yfinance API to scrape the sp500 financials as a list and gives historical data up to the beginning of the company going public.

### chart.py would run on barchart's market data instead of the wiki, but is locked behind barchart's paywall.
### main.py utilizes the wiki info of the SP500 and is the main part of the project. 

### To run the market helper, enter the following in the terminal: streamlit run main.py
